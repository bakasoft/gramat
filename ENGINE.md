## Processing Arrays

- If the property is not defined yet, it will be initialized as an array.
- If the property is not an array, depending on [the settings](SETTINGS.md) it could either be converted to an array or throw an error.
- If the property is already an array, the item is simply added.
- Since the arrays are not hard typed, a single array can contain any kind of values.
