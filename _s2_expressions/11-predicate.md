### Predicate

Only matches one character by comparing against characters and character ranges.

```gramat
`option1 option2 optionN`
```

The options are separated by whitespace and can be any of following patterns:

- **Exact character**: Matches exactly the specified character, e.g. `c`.
- **Character range**: Matches all character between the indicated begin and end characters, e.g. `a..z`.

The characters can be also specified by using [Escaped Characters](#escaped-characters).
